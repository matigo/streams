# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation site for the 10Centuries API. Here we will help you understand what sort of features and functions from 10Centuries you can implement and use in your own applications.

Have a question? Get in touch via [the Contact form]([HOMEURL]/contact) or, better yet, use the [Social Site](https://beta.nice.social) to get more immediate answers to your questions.

### Example Code

There is some basic example code in the documentation, but the best place to see the code in action is on 10Centuries-powered websites directly. All of the JavaScript that makes the dynamic pages come to life is readable and open source.

### Open Source?

This is the fifth revision of the 10centuries platform and will be completely open source in the near future. Be sure to check back to find out when you can host your own instance of this IndieWeb-friendly publishing platform.

### Develop

Want to build an application that makes 10Centuries better? We'd love to hear what you're working on! Feel free to get in touch.
