                <h1>What's all this about?</h1>
                <p><em>Answering some of the more common questions that people ask about this place.</em></p>

                <h3>What is Nice.Social?</h3>
                <p>Nice.Social is the social networking aspect of the <a href="https://10centuries.org" title="10Centuries">10Centuries</a> publishing platform, where people can interact with each other and see a running stream of blog posts, article clippings, podcasts, photos, and just about anything else people might want to share online.</p>

                <h3>What is 10Centuries?</h3>
                <p>10Centuries is <a href="https://github.com/matigo/streams" title="Github | Streams">an open source publishing platform</a> that has the goal of preserving and presenting posts, pictures, podcasts, and ideas that people have for one thousand years.</p>

                <h3>Why would I want to join?</h3>
                <p>The community on Nice.Social is comprised primarily of people who see social networks as a mild pastime and, as a result, the flow of conversation is generally more relaxed and readable than on more popular services. Anybody is welcome to join if they like what they see <a href="[HOMEURL]" title="[SITE_NAME]">in the public timeline</a>.</p>

                <h3>How do I join?</h3>
                <p>A 10Centuries account is needed to join Nice.Social, as the two services are actually the same thing. Once you have a 10Centuries account, you can sign in to Nice.Social and begin telling your story.</p>

                <h3>Where are the advertisements?</h3>
                <p>There will never be any advertisements on Nice.Social or any 10Centuries site. The service is funded through optional subscriptions from generous supporters as well as by the founder of the platform.</p>

                <h3>What do you track?</h3>
                <p>There is no active tracking systems in place, but every time data is requested from the servers, a little bit of information is recorded. This data includes your IP address, whether you were signed in at the time, what browser (or agent) you are using, and how long the request took to generate. This data is kept for 30 days before being automatically deleted. The purpose of the access log is to track service reliability patterns, not the people using the service.</p>

                <h3>Can I get my data back?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Any data that you provide to the service belongs to you and nobody else. You may at any time request all of your data in a downloadable format. If you elect to delete your account, all of your data is immediately removed from the system. Backups of the posts are eliminated over a period of 30 days.</p>

                <h3>Where can I learn more?</h3>
                <p>If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask them on <a href="[SITE_URL]" title="[SITE_NAME]">Nice.Social</a>.</p>
